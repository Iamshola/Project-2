# Project 2 - REACT APP

## Overview
​
The second project is to **build a React application** that consumes a **public API**.
The completed project can be viewed at https://iamshola.github.io/Project-2/#/
​
### Technical Requirements
​
Your app must:
​
* **Consume a public API** – this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.
* **Have several components** - At least one classical and one functional.
* **The app should include a router** - with several "pages".
* **Include wireframes** - that you designed before building the app.
* Have **semantically clean HTML** - you make sure you write HTML that makes structural sense rather than thinking about how it might look, which is the job of CSS.
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public.
