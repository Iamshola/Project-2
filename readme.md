# Project 2 - REACT APP

## Overview
​
The second project is to **build a React application** that consumes a **public API**.
The completed project can be viewed at https://iamshola.github.io/Project-2/#/
​
### Technical Requirements
​
Your app must:
​
* **Consume a public API** – this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.
* **Have several components** - At least one classical and one functional.
* **The app should include a router** - with several "pages".
* **Include wireframes** - that you designed before building the app.
* Have **semantically clean HTML** - you make sure you write HTML that makes structural sense rather than thinking about how it might look, which is the job of CSS.
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public.


## Project Reflection

### Technologies used
  - REACT
  - CSS
  - HTML
  - Javascript
  - Lodash
  - Bulma

### Approach taken - Thought process & methods of producing it
  - Basic MVP, couple searches, including an API  


###  Snippets of your code and screenshots of your project and wireframes


### Wins and Blockers
Wins:
I like the final look of the project. I believe its clean, well designed

Blockers:
We should have understood our API better to decide which features we'd like to include in our App. 

### Future features
   More filters such as filter by ingredients such as 'does their drink contain sprite, vodka and lemon'.


### What you have learned (tech & soft skills)

#### Tech skills:
This project was a good opportunity to solidify my knowledge around react.

#### Soft skills:
Communication between myself and my team mate.
Organisation
Detailed planning and plan of execution
